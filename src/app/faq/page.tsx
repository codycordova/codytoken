Check our 'Purchase' page for detailed instructions."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need a wallet to use CODY Token?",
        answer: "Yes, you'll need a Stellar wallet to hold and trade CODY tokens. Popular options include Lobstr (mobile-friendly), StellarX (web-based), or Freighter (browser extension). All of these wallets support CODY token and make it easy to manage your tokens."
    },
    {
        question: "Is CODY Token an investment?",
        answer: "No, CODY Token is not a security, investment, or financial product. It's a fun, community-based project with no expected return on investment.

    },
    {
        question: "How do I establish a trustline to CODY?",
        answer: "To hold CODY tokens, you need to establish a trustline. In your Stellar wallet, go to 'Add Asset' or 'Manage Assets', then search for 'CODY' with the asset code 'CODY' and issuer 'GAW55YAX46HLIDRONLOLUWP672HTFXW5WWTEI2T7OXVEFEDE5UKQDJAK'. Confirm the trustline and you'll be able to receive CODY tokens."
    },
    {
        question: "Is CODY Token safe?",
        answer: "CODY Token is built on the Stellar blockchain, which is a secure and well-established network. However, as with any cryptocurrency, you should practice good security habits like keeping your seed phrase safe, using reputable wallets, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Always verify you're interacting with the official CODY token contract."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use CODY Token on my phone?",

        question: "What's the difference between CODY Token and other cryptocurrencies?",
        answer: "CODY Token is unique because it's created by a specific artist (Cody Cordova) and is designed to support his creative projects directly. Unlike general-purpose cryptocurrencies, CODY has a specific use case: connecting fans with an artist's work and merchandise. It's built on Stellar, which offers fast, low-cost transactions compared to other blockchains."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I stay updated on CODY Token news?",
